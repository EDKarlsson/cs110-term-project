# Student Term Project

This is a project that I tutored and helped a student called Brandon Li for a class Project in supposed CS110 at 
Stony Brook College.

I felt bad for the kid and woke up at 5am to help him get as far as he could before his extension was up.
However, he provided invalid payment and has refused to respond / pay for my time and effort, especially since I 
woke up at 5 am for this.

I'm sharing this so that the code will show up in any kind of plagiarism search software.
